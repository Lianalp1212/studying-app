# Studying App
## App description
This app was designed to help people study. It has a variety of question styles:

- Multiple choice
- Multiple select
- True or false
- Open response
- Drop down selection

At the end of the quiz, users will be able to see what questions they answered correctly and incorrectly, receiving a score and the correct answers versus what they responded with. 
Throughout the quiz, users will be unable to go back. They must complete the quiz. In the Summary screen, along with viewing their score, users are able to retake the quiz.

## My contributions
This app started as a project in my Mobile Development class. I extended this app by creating new question styles. I created the open response and drop down selection style questions. For the format of the drop down I used [Headless UI's listbox.](https://headlessui.com/react/listbox)
